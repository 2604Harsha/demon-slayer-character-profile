                <hr>
                <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 18px;">Kyojuro was a young man of tall stature and lean-muscular build, with fair skin. He had 
                    long bright yellow hair with red streaks akin to flames along with two shoulder-length
                    bangs and two chin-length bangs on the side of his head, black forked eyebrows, and
                    golden eyes that fade to red with white pupils. He was known to be charismatic and 
                    had an air of great optimism, having an enthusiastic smile plastered on his face 
                    nearly all the time.Kyojuro wore the standard Demon Slayer Corps uniform, which is black in 
                    the manga and tinted a deep brown in the anime. It consisted of a brown button-up jacket with 
                    a stand-up collar and long sleeves, featuring gold buttons and a shirt pocket on the left 
                    breast, with the kanji for Destroy</p>

                <hr>
               <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 18px;">Kyojuro was greatly enthusiastic in regard to his duties as a <mark>Hashira</mark>, and often came across as
                cheerfully eccentric. He was amiable, pure of heart, and boasted extraordinary technique and 
                swordsmanship stemming from strict practice and discipline. He was an honorable warrior who 
                adhered to his code of morals and principles that was instilled into him by <mark>his mother </mark>at a 
                young age; the most significant being his belief that those who were born strong have a duty 
                to protect the weak.Kyojuro also loved his family immensely, displaying great respect and worry towards his father, 
                <mark>Shinjuro Rengoku</mark>, despite him growing slowly more aggressive and apathetic towards Kyojuro. 
                He was incredibly encouraging and optimistic towards his little brother, <mark>Senjuro Rengoku</mark>,
                believing in him and wishing him the best no matter what. This was further accentuated 
                during his death where his final words for his father and his little brother were "take 
                care of your body" and "follow your dreams no matter what". Kyojuro also believed that 
                if someone lacks immense skill, their hard work towards their dreams and desire to help people doesn't count for nothing.
                Beneath his enthusiastic demeanor, Kyojuro was very logical and tactically intelligent, acting quickly 
                and precisely in battle, especially when the lives of others are on the line. Kyojuro was also great 
                in seeing talent in others, even in <mark>Nezuko Kamado</mark>, a demon that he wanted to kill beforehand, after 
                seeing her risk her life to fight and protect others. Though he was extremely optimistic, Kyojuro did 
                sometimes have a sense of foreboding that those he believed in might die, especially his friends </p>

                <hr>
                <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 18px;">As a Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Kyojuro was a 
                    very powerful and skilled combatant.Before he took his father's place, Kyojuro was already 
                    shown to be an amazing fighter. He successfully avenged the death of the 9 Demon Slayers that 
                    died to the <mark>Flute Demon</mark> by himself and later managed to singlehandedly defeat<mark>Lower Rank Two,Hairo</mark> 
                    , who even appraised his swordsmanship before he died. Moreover, his father, <mark>Shinjuro 
                    Rengoku</mark>, stated that, after he stopped teaching his son, Kyojuro trained himself to become a
                    Hashira by learning from the guide book of the <mark>Flame Breathing</mark> style, a book which only had 
                    three volumes.As another testament to his abilities, <mark>Akaza</mark>, the Upper Rank Three and one of 
                    the strongest known demons, acknowledged and praised Kyojuro's strength.He even went as 
                    far as to offer to turn him into a demon so he could surpass his human limits and become 
                    stronger, something he only offered to swordsmen whose abilities he believed were refined to 
                    their utmost peak kaza also complimented his fighting spirit and stated that it was getting
                     close to the "Realm of the Highest," which implied that he was incredibly close to obtaining
                      the <mark>Transparent World</mark></p>

            <span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Indomitable Will:</strong></span>
            <span style="font-size: 18px;"> Kyojuro had an undaunted spirit and indomitable willpower, which even impressed the likes of Upper Rank Three, <mark>Akaza.</mark>
                Ever since he was a child, he has had a strong will and passion in himself due to his promise to his late mother.
                 Even when the Upper Rank overwhelmed him with powerful attacks, giving Kyojuro insidious wounds, he remained
                 steadfast and resolute.After Kyojuro lost an eye and had internal wounds caused by Akaza, he still persisted,
                  vehemently expressing his unwavering will and determination, saying that he will protect the lives of the 
                  other innocent people no matter what.[10] Finally, when Akaza's fist pierced his solar plexus, it triggered 
                  a memory reminding Kyojuro of his mother again, giving him the final push to cut the Upper Rank's neck.
                   In the end, though his efforts were in vain, his incredible determination had a profound effect on Tanjiro, 
                   giving the incentive to push on no matter the turmoil he faced</span>

            <span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Keen Intellect:</strong></span>
            <span style="font-size: 18px;">As a swordsman who came from a lineage of Flame Hashira, Kyojuro had
                 access to generations of combat knowledge and tactics as well as training from previous Flame 
                 Hashira, like his father, Shinjuro Rengoku. Kyojuro could also master the entire<mark> Flame 
                 Breathing</mark> style just from reading 3 volumes of a book on it. During the battle against Akaza, 
                 he displayed keen judgement like after being attacked by Akaza's Destructive Death: Air Type,
                  he realizes that he must fight at close range with he wanted to increase the chances of cutting 
                  of his head.Even when the usually deductive and sagacious Tanjiro Kamado was at a loss of
                   how to kill Enmu,</span>

                <span style="font-size: 18px;">As a Hashira, Kyojuro possessed tremendous speed and reflexes, 
                    so much so that even gifted Demon Slayers like Tanjiro and Inosuke Hashibira were unable to 
                    register his clash with Akaza, with the latter stating that he was on a different dimension.
                    Kyojuro could even cause tremors to the ground and nearly launching a train off its tracks
                    by running at such high speeds Moreover, Kyojuro could easily move at speeds much faster
                    than the eye can see, decapitating demons before they can even react. His reflexes were so 
                    fast that he managed to cut Akaza's arm moments before the Upper Rank was going to hit Tanjiro.
                    Kyojuro also managed to keep up with Akaza's high-speed techniques and incredibly swift movements
                    , which he remarks is faster than the blink of an eye</span>

            </span>
            <span style="font-size: 18px;">Kyojuro displayed superhuman stamina and endurance during his battles
                over the course of the series. In his battle with the Flute Demon, Kyojuro ruptured his eardrums,
                yet didn't flinch in the slightest, ignoring the pain and continuing to fight and win. In his 
                battle with Hairo, he suffered dozens of severe wounds and injuries from gunshots and explosions
                coming from the former Lower Rank Two but continued to stall enough time for all the bombs he 
                planted to be disarmed without showing any signs of pain or fatigue, which shocked Hairo into 
                questioning whether the person he met in the past was really the same person he was fighting 
                now.</span>

            <span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Immense Strength:</strong></span>
            <span style="font-size: 18px;">Having spent years of perfecting his physical prowess, Kyojuro possessed amazing physical strength,
                being capable of swinging his katana at speeds faster than the eye can see incessantly with faultless
                accuracy while engaging in combat and even sending Akaza flying an astonishing distance into a forest
                with a single blade swing. Kyojuro could also lift an entire train off its tracks by simply dashing forward.
                Even when he first became a recognized Demon Slayer, he had enough strength to instantly rupture his own 
                eardrums by hitting his ears with his hands. Kyojuro also possessed exceptional grip strength that enabled
                him to hold down Akaza, one of the physically strongest characters in the series, despite having his 
                solar plexus pierced earlier and sustaining multiple other fatal wounds, to the point which Akaza 
                expressed his disbelief and shock over Kyojuro's strength which he describes as "unbelievable"</span>

                <span style="font-size: 18px;">Kyojuro had incredibly honed senses, such as when he was able to 
                    sense and perceive Akaza's immense presence and demon aura.Kyojuro was also capable of sensing
                    demonic presences faster and more accurately than Tanjiro Kamado, who harbors an acute 
                    sense of smell, when he detected two demons right after another on a train before anyone 
                    else noticed.This ability also allowed him to precisely gauge the regenerative abilities
                    and weaknesses of most demons, like Enmu.[14] Kyojuro was also able to perceive Tanjiro's 
                    injuries and torn blood vessel accurately, which allowed him to teach him how to plug up 
                    that wound and prevent him from dying of blood loss</span>

                <span style="font-size: 18px;">As a Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Kyojuro was one of the most 
                    powerful and skilled swordsmen in the entire organization.[25] Additionally, Kyojuro is part of
                    the Rengoku family which has an impressive lineage of powerful swordsmen and Flame Hashira, 
                    giving Kyojuro an edge in developing and polishing his swordsmanship. His extraordinary 
                    swordsmanship skill has been displayed on multiple occasions across the series.In his battle 
                    against the former Lower Rank Two, Hairo, Kyojuro was able to out-wield the demon's bushido 
                    sword style, which Hairo appraised as he was decapitated. Kyojuro's precise blade work could 
                    also slow down Enmu in his fused form, which gave him the opportunity to explain his plan to 
                    Tanjiro and Inosuke. His mastery of the blade is best showcased during his battle with Akaza,
                    in which he was more than capable of fighting on equal ground with the Upper Rank who had
                    killed countless Demon Slayers and even multiple Hashiras over the last century, even to
                    the point that Akaza constantly praised Kyojuro's swordsmanship</span>

                      Flame Hashira in the Rengoku Family.As the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro is his generation's most 
                      skilled Flame Breathing user. He became evidently proficient in fighting with this Breathing 
                      Style, being able to singlehandedly defeat former Lower Rank Two, Hairo and later hold his

                        slashes from their respective Breathing Styles from opposite sides. The Flame Breather 
                        then readies his stance to use Rengoku and the Sun Breather takes a similar stance to 
                        use Sun Halo Dragon Head Dance. The result is both charging at the opponent in an attack
                         that takes the form of a flaming Japanese dragon composed of flames from both styles.
                        Both users yell "Set your heart ablaze!", and their attack ends with an X-shaped slash

                        their attacks to send their opponent in each other's direction. The Sound Breather then 
                        hurls explosive beads at their opponent after they are sent airborne, and is then joined 
                        by the Flame Breather who executes Flame Tiger as they jump upward. When they make contact
                        with the target, the result is them being attacked by the blades of both Flame and Sound 
                        Breathing users</span>

                    that was white and grey in color.In Kyojuro's final stand against Akaza, the demon snaps the
                    blade off it's handle as Kyojuro actively tries to behead him, discarding it in a forest as he
                    flees from the sunlight. </span>
